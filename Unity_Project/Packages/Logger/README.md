# A Package for Enhanced Logging

* Tired of doing a lot of typing when logging throughout your projects?
* Tired of having very little control over what is being logged where?

Then this is the package for you!

## Usage

To send logs, simply use these throughout your code:

```C#
Log.I("My info log message");
Log.W("My warning log message")
Log.E("My error log message");
```

## LogLevel Attributes
To manage what LogLevels you want to log, try out the amazing [LogLevel Attributes](Documentation/LogLevelAttributes.md).

## Color Scheme
To edit the color scheme of an already existing Logger or your own custom Logger, take a look at this [Color Scheme Tutorial](Documentation/ColorScheme.md).
